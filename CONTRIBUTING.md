## How to contribute
Glad you wish to help the project! If you haven't already, please visit the project's public discord server which can be found below.

Here are some important resources:
* [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/coaster3000/GravityMod-forge/issues) is used to manage issues and tickets for the project, 
* [Our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kPKqqPp) is used for communications which includes support for the project. 

## Testing
The project uses [testNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html) for testing. Please write test code for your contributions whenever possible.
Due to the nature of the project, there will be areas where this is not possible and cannot use automated tests.

## Submitting Changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to [GravityMod-forge](https://github.com/coaster3000/GravityMod-forge) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding Conventions
We use checkstyle to ensure coding conventions are kept. We strive to following the following rules.

Currently the rules are not documented for the project. Please execute checkstyle to ensure you are following the current convention.
